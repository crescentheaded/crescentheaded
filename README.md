# hello dear visitor ヾ(๑╹◡╹)ﾉ"

this ~~social network profile~~ github page is dedicated to the consequences of talking to computers



## — whose talking?
*my* talking. i’ve never been good at maintaining carbon-based living form, but it seems like **interacting with technology brings me *genuine* joy**, so...



## — ok, so what are you doing exactly?
lately I’ve been learning to **develop *software* using [swift](https://www.swift.org/about/) programming language**

in the past lives i had some luck to interact with compooters and mathematics, but anyway this is only the beginning of my creational journey!

i really enjoy coding on swift though. convenient and precise language. also it feels like i will eventually end up somewhere about **ux** and **accessibility**



## about what I produce
in addition to my unironic excitement, i prefer to **share the acquired knowledge**

sequentally, the products of my tinkering will transform into an educational representation of my experience too

### **documentation** for finished projects goes there:

here you can see at what point my software development education is now 

https://github.com/crescentheaded/studies

### if there is something big i want to share with internet i publish an article:

so a link to my blog about my it-journey is expected to appear here one day:

https://yesthisisthelink.verysorry

### additionally, you can see **the codes** here, on github:

### **documentation** for finished projects goes there:

https://thislink.doesntexist/yet



## — you are weird. how do i tell you that?
no fucking idea yet (◞‸◟) i really expect myself to fill **the contacts in the profile** one day...

please keep in mind that **a also speak russian**, so there is no problem in talking to me in it too! 



### hope you find this page useful!  ヽ(*＾ω＾*)ﾉ
