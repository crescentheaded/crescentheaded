# hello dear visitor ヾ(๑╹◡╹)ﾉ"

this ~~social network profile~~ github page is dedicated to the consequences of talking to computers



## — whose talking?
*my* talking. i’ve never been good at maintaining carbon-based living form, but it seems like **interacting with technology brings me *genuine* joy**, so...



## — ok stop. so what are you doing exactly?

even though i got some technical background (such as mathematical education and general interest in technology), i'd never actually been involved in it-development.

living this life'd been pointing me toward creation of **digital solutions** more than toward doing anything else, so here we are.

lately I’ve been learning to **develop *software* using [swift](https://www.swift.org/about/) programming language**.

at the moment i'm only discovering what can be done and by what means, but i think i *seriously* enjoy coding on swift, so our friendship may long. 

not that i want myself to be a swift magister or something, it just helps me to express my ideas and solve my problems. i think eventually i'll end up somewhere about **ux** and **accessibility**, because the only thing i require from the products of my work is to be as inclusive as possible both for the "business" and the "clients". in my experience, variety as a concept is the greatest part of the universe and i want to serve it in accordance with my awe 



## about what I produce
in addition to my unironic excitement, i prefer to **share the acquired knowledge**

sequentally, the products of my tinkering will transform into an educational representation of my experience too

### **educational resources** i've consumed in order to be able to do something:

here you can see at what point my software development education is now

### if there is something big i want to share with internet i publish an article:

so a link to my blog about my it-journey is expected to appear here one day:

https://yesthisisthelink.verysorry

### additionally, you can see **the codes** here, on github:

https://github.com/crescentheaded?tab=repositories

### **documentation** for finished projects goes there:

https://thislink.doesntexist/yet



## — you are weird. how do i tell you that?
no fucking idea yet (◞‸◟) i really expect myself to fill **the contacts in the profile** one day...

please keep in mind that **i also speak russian**, so there is no problem in talking to me in it too! 



### hope you find this page useful!  ヽ(*＾ω＾*)ﾉ
