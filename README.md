# Hello dear visitor ヾ(๑╹◡╹)ﾉ"

This ~~social network profile~~ GitHub page is dedicated to the consequences of talking to computers.



## — Whose talking?
*My* talking. I’ve never been good at maintaining carbon-based living form, but it seems like **interacting with technology brings me *genuine* joy**. 

So for as long as I live, I’m interested in having quality time with technological pieces, which results in me wanting to know how **to make computers serve me exactly as I wish**. 



## — Ok, so what are you doing exactly?
Lately I’ve been learning to **develop *software* using [Swift](https://www.swift.org/about/) programming language**.

Even though I got mathematics and no fear of machines in the background, this is only the beginning of my creational journey!

I really enjoy coding on Swift though. Convenient and precise language.



## About what I produce
In addition to my unironic excitement, I prefer to **share the acquired knowledge**.

Sequentally, the products of my tinkering will transform into an educational representation of my experience too.

### If there is something big I want to share with Internet I publish an article. 

So a link to my blog about my IT-journey is expected to appear here one day:

https://yesthisisthelink.verysorry

### Additionally, you can see **the codes** here, on GitHub:

https://github.com/crescentheaded?tab=repositories

### **Documentation** for finished projects goes there:

## — You are weird. How do I convey this opinion to you?
No fucking idea yet (◞‸◟) I really expect myself to fill **the contacts in the profile** one day...

Please keep in mind that **I also speak Russian**, so there is no problem in talking to me in it too! 



### Hope you find this page useful!  ヽ(*＾ω＾*)ﾉ
