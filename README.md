# hello dear visitor ヾ(๑╹◡╹)ﾉ"

this ~~social network profile~~ github page is dedicated to the consequences of talking to computers.



## — whose talking?
*my* talking. i’ve never been good at maintaining carbon-based living form, but it seems like **interacting with technology brings me *genuine* joy**. 

so for as long as i live, i’m interested in having quality time with technological pieces, which results in me wanting to know how **to make computers serve me exactly as i wish**. 



## — ok, so what are you doing exactly?
lately I’ve been learning to **develop *software* using [swift](https://www.swift.org/about/) programming language**.

even though i got mathematics and no fear of machines in the background, this is only the beginning of my creational journey!

i really enjoy coding on swift though. convenient and precise language.



## about what I produce
in addition to my unironic excitement, i prefer to **share the acquired knowledge**.

sequentally, the products of my tinkering will transform into an educational representation of my experience too.

### if there is something big i want to share with internet i publish an article. 

so a link to my blog about my it-journey is expected to appear here one day:

https://yesthisisthelink.verysorry

### additionally, you can see **the codes** here, on github:

https://github.com/crescentheaded?tab=repositories

### **documentation** for finished projects goes there:

https://thislink.doesntexist/yet



## — you are weird. How do i convey this opinion to you?
no fucking idea yet (◞‸◟) i really expect myself to fill **the contacts in the profile** one day...

please keep in mind that **a also speak russian**, so there is no problem in talking to me in it too! 



### hope you find this page useful!  ヽ(*＾ω＾*)ﾉ
